not sure what "normalize the historical averages" means but here's my take

GOAL: Fix probabilities being skewed low for recently introduced megaballs

Start: For "previous 1 year" powerball frequency is counted starting from previous 1 year.
1. "recent_number_frequency" : powerball number frequencies starting from the previous year
2. number_probabilities now counts from "recent_number_frequency"'

Progress:
EDITs made: #24, #50, #60
